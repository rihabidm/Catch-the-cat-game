# CatchTheCat Game - Python Project

## Overview

Welcome to CatchTheCat, an engaging strategy game implemented in Python! This project introduces a grid-based game where the player's objective is to catch the elusive cat before it escapes to a designated area. The game employs the Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms to provide an intelligent and challenging opponent.

## How to Play

1. Run the `chat.py` file to start the game.
2. Click on a grid cell to make your move and attempt to trap the cat.
3. The cat will use Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to strategize its escape.
4. Keep making moves until the cat is either caught or successfully reaches its escape zone.
5. Challenge yourself against the clever AI cat!

## Project Structure

- `catch_the_cat.py`: The main script implementing the CatchTheCat game using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- `gui.py`: A GUI file with potential improvements and visual enhancements for future iterations.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions supporting the game logic and algorithms.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python catch_the_cat.py
```

## Future Improvements

Explore the `gui.py` file for potential enhancements to the game interface. Feel free to contribute and share your ideas for making CatchTheCat even more enjoyable!
